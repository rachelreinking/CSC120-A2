What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    What I found most helpful was to carefully look over the procedural approach to the assignment
    in order to understand exactly what was required to make the program functional. Then, I wrote 
    down each of the components of the program and categorized them based on which class I thought 
    they belonged to. I found the OneCard example from class very useful in understanding how to 
    write in Python in an objected-oriented manner, and the video was a useful primer that helped 
    me to know I was starting the assignment off on the right foot. I would also create one 
    function at a time and test and run it until it was at least mostly functional before building 
    upon it or moving to a new part. I found this testing and debugging in a piece-by-piece manner 
    helpful, and I would recommend this approach to someone else taking this course in the future.

    I also broke down the update_price, update_os, and refurbish functions so they were partially 
    present in both classes. I thought of these functions in the computer class as updating the
    computer and these functions in the resale shop class as updating the inventory to reflect the
    changes made to the computer. I'm not sure if this is technically the "correct" way to do this
    or the most efficient, but it is what made sense in my head as my approach to object-oriented 
    programming and it worked for me.
